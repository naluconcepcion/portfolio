# Tech Projects

**TechNaluGie** \[[landing](https://www.technalugie.com/)] — a simple static webpage I created in the summer of 2017 to advertise a computer science course I held. 

**Solar Bench** \[[landing](https://interactive-solar-exhibit.herokuapp.com/) / [source](https://github.com/naluconcepcion/interactive-solar-exhibit)] — a website I created in the fall of 2018 using React frontend to compute and render some summary statistics about a solar bench project my friends and I built as an independent project in our final year of high school. 

**PaClubs** \[[landing](https://pa-clubs.herokuapp.com/) / [source](https://github.com/naluconcepcion/pa-clubs)]  — a React-based webpage I created in the spring of 2019 with a classmate as a final project for a full-stack AppDev class. Meant to help students more quickly find relevant points of contact for on-campus clubs.  I was primarily responsible for data cleaning (since we rendered a FlatList of items from a spreadsheet) and handling user authentication. 

**Myto** — a ReactNative app (coupled with Firebase backend and hosting services) built over 7-8 weeks this past summer. Myto is meant to empower college students to share and shop locally. I was one of two primary developers on the team. I worked on optimizing our data flows (writing to database, designing authentication, structuring global-app-state via Redux) and overseeing database management (structuring objects, image compression, scalability research). I also helped to translate the wireframe design into a responsive frontend UI. Unfortunately, I can’t show this prototype because it contains sensitive design elements which my teammates expressed they’d prefer I not show off yet. 

**OnT00** \[landing is a part of the [source](https://github.com/srikaryallala/hackMIT)] — a React Native app two friends and I created (~36 hours ago in < 24 hours total work coding) for HackMIT. OnT00 is meant to be a location-based social media to enable individuals to connect with people nearby. (Still in development, but the final deliverable we had for the Hackathon is linked above.) For this project, I handled MapUI usage to fetch user location to accurately render the map and our user's current location. I also built out the app’s frontend navigational flow and structured chat/location/user data collections in the Firebase backend.
