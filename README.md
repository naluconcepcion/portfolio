# Projects

**RISC-V Interpreter** – A C interpreter for the RISC-V assembly language, supporting a variety of R, I, S, and U-type instructions according to the RISC-V manual specifications, offering support for memory up to 2^31 bits large. This interpreter was built independently in the Fall of 2021. (Available upon request; due to academic integrity clauses, I cannot release my code publicly.)

**RISC-V Single Cycle Processor** – A RISC-V processor supporting a variety of R, I, S, and U-type instructions according to the RISC-V manual specifications. This project was built independently in the Fall of 2021 using the Logisim simulator. (Available upon request; due to academic integrity clauses, I cannot release my code publicly.)

**Functional Chess** \[[source](https://github.com/henryrobbins/chess)] – a semester-long OCaml-based project I built in close collaboration with three other Cornell classmates. My contributions were primarily in implementing the Puzzle Rush mode as well as with assisting with implementing uncommon moves such as pawn promotions and castling. 

**Stochastic Simulation** – I simulated a few million episodes of a store's fluctuations in inventory levels, demand levels, and profits using a discrete time Markov Chain (DTMC) model, and then trained a neural network on the output data to predict the next day's profits given only the previous data generated by the Markov chain. My final RMSE for my neural network was under 0.03. (Available upon request; due to academic integrity clauses, I cannot release my code publicly.)

**Myto** — a ReactNative app (coupled with Firebase backend and hosting services) built over 7-8 weeks over the summer of 2020. Myto is meant to empower college students to share and shop locally. I was the project founder, as well one of two primary developers on the team. I worked on optimizing our data flows (writing to database, designing authentication, structuring global-app-state via Redux) and overseeing database management (structuring objects, image compression, scalability research). I also helped to translate the wireframe design into a responsive frontend UI. Unfortunately, I can’t show this prototype because it contains sensitive design elements which my teammates expressed they’d prefer I not show off yet.

**TechNaluGie** \[[landing](https://www.technalugie.com/)] — a simple static webpage I created in the summer of 2017 to advertise a free computer science course I held.

**OnT00** \[landing is a part of the [source](https://github.com/srikaryallala/hackMIT)] — a React Native app two friends and I created (~36 hours ago in < 24 hours total work coding) for HackMIT. OnT00 is meant to be a location-based social media to enable individuals to connect with people nearby. (Still in development, but the final deliverable we had for the Hackathon is linked above.) For this project, I handled MapUI usage to fetch user location to accurately render the map and our user's current location. I also built out the app’s frontend navigational flow and structured chat/location/user data collections in the Firebase backend.

**Solar Bench** \[[landing](https://interactive-solar-exhibit.herokuapp.com/) / [source](https://github.com/naluconcepcion/interactive-solar-exhibit)] — a website I created in the fall of 2018 using React frontend to compute and render some summary statistics about a solar bench project my friends and I built as an independent project in our final year of high school.

**PaClubs** \[[landing](https://pa-clubs.herokuapp.com/) / [source](https://github.com/naluconcepcion/pa-clubs)]  — a React-based webpage I created in the spring of 2019 with a classmate as a final project for a full-stack AppDev class. Meant to help students more quickly find relevant points of contact for on-campus clubs.  I was primarily responsible for data cleaning (since we rendered a FlatList of items from a spreadsheet) and handling user authentication.
